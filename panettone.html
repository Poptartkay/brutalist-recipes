   <h1>Panettone Loaves</h1> 
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups candied mixed fruit</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons orange zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cream</li>
            
        
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        To make sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot water. Pour in warm water and sprinkle 1 package yeast on it. <br>
        Let stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 30 minutes, or until doubled. <br>
         Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let stand until dissolved. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla. <br>
        Stir in milk-yeast mixture. Add sponge and stir until well incorporated.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Combine butter and remaining 3 1/2 cups flour until crumbly. <br>
        Slowly pour in egg mixture and beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic looking and long strands form. <br>
        Beat in fruit and zests. <br>
         Turn dough into oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Fold down bags to form a 3-inch cuff. Brush inside and out with melted butter. <br>
        Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to deflate. <br> 
        Divide dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared bags. <br>
        Place bags on a baking sheet about 4-inches apart and cover loosely with plastic wrap. <br>
         Let rise in a warm place until doubled again, about 2 hours.


    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut an X in top of each loaf with oiled scissors. <br>
        Combine egg yolk with cream. Brush tops of loaves lightly with egg wash.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Place baking sheet in bottom 1/3 of oven. After 10 minutes, lower heat to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C).<br>
         Bake for 30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil. <br>
         Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers comes out clean. Cool on wire rack.
