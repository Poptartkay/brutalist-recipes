    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm milk (115 degrees F (46 degrees C))</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup orange marmalade</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>½ cup old-fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
     
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh cranberries</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Combine warm water and yeast in a large bowl; stir to dissolve. Add warm milk, egg, marmalade, and butter. Stir to combine.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Mix flour, oats, and salt together in a separate bowl. Add to yeast mixture and stir until moistened. <br>
        Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat both sides. <br>
         Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.

    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, combine cranberries, brown sugar, and water in a small saucepan.<br>
         Cook over medium heat until cranberries begin to soften, 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
         Remove from heat; stir in walnuts, butter, and lemon juice. Let cool.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Punch dough down. Roll dough into a 10x20-inch rectangle on a floured surface.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Whisk egg white and water together. Brush lightly over the dough. <br>
        Spread cranberry filling over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. <br>
         Roll up tightly, starting from a long edge. Seal edges and cut off any tapered sides with no filling.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Transfer roll to a large square baking sheet. Join ends together to form a ring. <br>
        Use sharp kitchen shears to make cuts at 1-inch intervals, cutting 2/3 of the way through the dough. <br>
        Twist each slice gently to expose the swirled filling. Gently shape dough into a perfect ring. <br>
         Cover and let rise until doubled, 20 to 25 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    </p>
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. <br>
        Cool on the baking sheet for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Let cool completely.


    </p>
    <h4>Step 9</h4>
    <p>
        Stir powdered sugar and orange juice concentrate together in a small bowl. <br>
        Add enough water to reach a glaze-like consistency. Drizzle glaze over tea ring. <br> 
        Allow glaze to set before slicing.
