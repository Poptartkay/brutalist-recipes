    <h1>Finnish Pulla</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>9 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the lukewarm milk, sugar, salt, cardamom, 4 eggs, and enough flour <br>
         to make a batter (approximately 2 cups). Beat until the dough is smooth and elastic. <br>
         Add about 3 cups of the flour and beat well; the dough should be smooth and glossy in appearance. <br> 
         Add the melted butter or margarine, and stir well. Beat again until the dough looks glossy. <br>
         Stir in the remaining flour until the dough is stiff. <br>


    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Turn out of bowl onto a floured surface, cover with an inverted mixing bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.<br>
         Knead the dough until smooth and satiny. Place in a lightly greased mixing bowl, <br>
         and turn the dough to grease the top. Cover with a clean dishtowel. <br>
          Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Punch down, and let rise again until almost doubled. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Turn out again on to a floured surface, and divide into 3 parts. Divide each third into 3 again. <br>
        Roll each piece into a 12 to 16 inch strip. Braid 3 strips into a loaf.<br>
         You should get 3 large braided loaves. Lift the braids onto greased baking sheets. Let rise for 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Brush each loaf with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Check occasionally because the bottom burns easily.
